## Usage
1. Download and install node.js
2. Clone this repository
3. With the cloned repo directory, execute `npm install`
4. Execute `./sbt`(this may take a while when executed for the first time; if necessary, execute `chmod 0755 sbt`)
5. Once the command prompt is up, execute `copyNpmToTarget` to copy all NPM dependencies to the `target` folder 
6. Finally, start the application by entering `~run` (again, this may take a while on first start-up; the tilde enables on-the-fly re-compilation)
7. Browse to http://localhost:9000
