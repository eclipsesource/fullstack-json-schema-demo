# Fullstack 2016 JSON Schema Demo

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory and execute `./sbt`(this may take a while when first executed; if necessary, `chmod 0755 sbt`)
2. Once the command prompt is up, download any NPM dependencies by entering the `getNpmDeps` command
3. Finally, start the application by entering `~run` (again, this may take a while on first start-up; the tilde enables on-the-fly re-compilation)
